# About me

I am a future talent looking for a new adventure in Fullstack Development. 
I have wide knowlegde in different business fields which is an advantage when 
developing programs to different types of customers. 

### My specialities

I love to solve problems, improve myself and the ways I work. I always think of the big picture, even though I love to focus on the smallest details. 
I’m very analytical and pedantic. Learning new things and becoming a professional in my own field is something I strive for.  

### Maybe something?

In my studies I mastered the basics of Full Stack Developing. My favorite things are SQL, C# and Asp.Net Core. 
I also enjoy using React and Node.js. I am a beginner in Azure, AWS and Python, but fortunately I’m exceptionally fast learner.
